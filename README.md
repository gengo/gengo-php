Gengo PHP Library (for the [Gengo API](http://gengo.com/api/))
======================================================================================================================================================
Translating your tools and products helps people all over the world access them; this is, of course, a somewhat tricky problem to solve.
**[Gengo](http://gengo.com/)** is a service that offers human-translation (which is often a higher quality than machine translation), and an API to
manage sending in work and watching jobs. This is a PHP interface to make using the API simpler (some would say incredibly easy).

This package contains both a client library for accessing the Gengo Translate API, as well as some example code showing how to use the library.


Installation & Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing the library is simple. Just add it to "require" of your composer.json
```
composer require gengo/gengo
```

Then inside of your code you can call:

```php
\Gengo\Config::setAPIkey("your_api_key");
\Gengo\Config::setPrivateKey("your_private_key");

$job1 = array(
    "type"     => "text",
    "slug"     => "API Liverpool 1",
    "body_src" => "Liverpool_1 Football Club is an English Premier League football club based in Liverpool, Merseyside.",
    "lc_src"   => "en",
    "lc_tgt"   => "ja",
    "tier"     => "standard",
    "force"    => 1,
);

$jobs = array("job_01" => $job1);

$api = new \Gengo\Jobs();
$api->postJobs($jobs);
$response = json_decode($api->getResponseBody(), true);
```

When you are ready to go live insert the following before calls to Gengo:

```php
\Gengo\Config::useProduction();
```

You can read through files in tests folder for more usage examples.
