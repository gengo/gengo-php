Gengo PHP Library (for the [Gengo API](http://gengo.com/))
==========================================================================================================================
Translating your tools and products helps people all over the world access them; this is, of course, a
somewhat tricky problem to solve. **[Gengo](http://gengo.com/)** is a service that offers human-translation
(which is often a higher quality than machine translation), and an API to manage sending in work and watching
jobs. This is a PHP interface to make using the API simpler (some would say incredibly easy).

This package contains both a client library for accessing the Gengo Translate API, as well as some example code showing how to
use the library.
